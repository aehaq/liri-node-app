# liri-node-app
The Liri Node App is an entirely back-end application that allows users to inquire about movies, songs, and musicians. This back-end application will then use certain node packages to hit the necessary APIs required to fulfill the users request. The requests are made and the responses are logged into the user's terminal, with no need to use a browser.
